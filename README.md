  <strong>DS5 Bridge 1.0 is live.</strong><br>
  The first stable release includes the Windows companion app, Pico 2 W firmware,
  profiles, visual button remapping, microphone support, and headphone-jack audio.
</p>

DS5 Bridge lets you use a real Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge controller
wirelessly on a Windows PC through a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. The controller pairs
to the Pico over Bluetooth, and the Pico plugs into your PC over USB.

The companion app gives you a clean place to adjust audio, haptics, trigger
strength, lighting, button remaps, shortcuts, and other controller behavior
without reflashing the Pico.

## Quick Start

1. Download the firmware `.uf2` and Windows companion installer from
   [Releases](https://github.com/SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge/releases/latest).
2. With the Pico 2 W unplugged, hold `BOOTSEL`, then connect it to your PC.
3. Copy the `.uf2` file onto the Pico drive that appears in Windows.
4. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode.
5. After the Pico restarts from flashing, wait for the controller to pair.
6. Install and open DS5 Bridge to check the connection and adjust your settings.

Once the controller connects to the Pico, Windows sees it as a normal
DualSense-compatible USB controller.

## Features

- Use a DualSense or DualSense Edge wirelessly through a Pico 2 W.
- Tune audio, haptics, adaptive triggers, and lighting from the Windows app.
- Save controller setups as profiles.
- Remap controller buttons visually.
- See Bluetooth signal quality at a glance.

## Companion App Tour

The companion app is where you check the bridge, adjust the controller, and save
the setup you actually want to play with.

### Overview

See the connection, battery, audio route, Bluetooth signal quality, active
profile, and the settings most likely to matter during play.

### Haptics

Adjust HD haptics and classic rumble strength, then test the feel before
opening a game.

### Audio

Control the controller speaker, headphone-jack audio, and microphone level.

</p>

### Triggers

Set adaptive trigger strength and try sample effects without leaving the app.

### Lighting

Choose lightbar brightness and color, or let the app manage lighting behavior
for you.

### Button Remapping

Change what each controller button does, then save the remap when you are happy
with it.

### System

Manage profiles, mute button behavior, polling rate, and diagnostics.

</p>

### Settings

Set UI scale, startup behavior, power saving, shortcuts, idle disconnect, PC
sleep disconnect, and the Pico LED.

## Troubleshooting

- If controller audio sounds doubled, distorted, or too loud, restart your PC,
  reopen DS5 Bridge, and run the speaker test again.
- Battery level may be inaccurate while the controller is charging.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.
- Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge controller.
- USB cable from the Pico 2 W to the PC.
- Windows for the companion app.

## For Developers

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for local build requirements,
firmware build commands, companion app setup, audio helper notes, and packaging
steps.

## Project Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.cpp` | Pico startup, watchdog handling, USB task loop, and HID report bridge. |
| `src/bt.cpp` | Bluetooth inquiry, pairing, L2CAP HID channels, and report queueing. |
| `src/audio.cpp` | USB audio ingestion, haptic resampling, Opus speaker encoding, and audio packet assembly. |
| `src/companion.cpp` | Vendor HID companion protocol, status reports, command ACKs, and runtime setting dispatch. |
| `src/usb.cpp` | TinyUSB audio control callbacks and runtime settings fallback. |
| `src/usb_descriptors.c` | USB device, configuration, HID report, audio, and string descriptors. |
| `companion/` | Electron companion app source, protocol parser, HID service, assets, and UI. |
| `companion/native/AudioHelper/` | Windows audio helper used by the companion app for audio sessions, haptics mirroring, endpoint setup, and media integrations. |
| `.github/workflows` | CI and release builds. |

## Development Notes

- The bridge presents itself to the host as a standard DualSense-compatible USB
  controller for compatibility.
- The companion app requires firmware built with the companion HID interface
  enabled.
- The project controls runtime behavior through the bridge and does not write
  controller-side profiles.
- Battery level is not reported accurately while the controller is charging.
- During development, Windows may keep stale controller or audio endpoint
  records after descriptor testing. Use
  [docs/windows-device-cleanup.md](docs/windows-device-cleanup.md) only if you
  run into device or endpoint issues while testing.
